## Project Goals  
**MVP**  
* Jumpstart allows user to enter username and password, and have a password stored securely.  
* The password has limits that are checked by Regex.  
* The user can review their database content and update their status.  
* The user can make a new job search and review the results.  
* The user can select a job to look for more details and then add them to database or return to search page.  

**STRETCH GOALS**
* Allow more CSS to use clickable icons instead of buttons
* More feedback to users when the registration or password is not appropriate
